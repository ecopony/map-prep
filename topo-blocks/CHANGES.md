# Recent Changes to Topo-Blocks

## Text Feature Addition

### What was added:
- Mountain name text display functionality in the `create_block_design()` method
- Text appears below the three rectangular blocks
- Right-aligned to the edge of the rightmost block
- Uses white serif font for elegant appearance

### Specific implementation details:
- Text positioning: `text_y = self.miny - (self.height * 0.02)` (very close to rectangles)
- Text alignment: `horizontalalignment='right'` at `text_x = self.maxx`
- Font: `family='serif'` with `weight='normal'`
- Color: `color='white'`
- Z-order: `zorder=10` to ensure text appears on top
- Adaptive sizing: Automatically scales with figure size unless custom `text_size` specified

### Layout adjustments:
- Bottom margin reduced to `self.height * 0.06` to accommodate close text positioning
- Plot limits extended with `ax.set_ylim(self.miny - margin, self.maxy)`

### Code location:
- Modified `create_block_design()` method in `main.py` around lines 241-267
- Text rendering code added before the "Remove axes" section

### Usage:
The mountain name parameter that was already part of the method signature now actually renders as text on the output image. No API changes required - existing calls will now show the text.
